# Taste

to the ones who love coffee.


## Why?

i built this project so can a number of people in one team select their preferred cup of coffee, with real time database
where every one who registered to the app and got signed in will have his favourite cup reset to null value until he selects his name, strenght and number of sugars he wants.


## Packages Used :
- FireStore : used as a RTDB.
- FireBase Auth : used to sign in & register
- Provider Package : used as a wrapper to decide which widget to show (Home or Auth).
- Flutter SpinKit : used as a Loading Widget.
